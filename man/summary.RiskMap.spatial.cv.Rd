\title{Summarize Cross-Validation Scores for Spatial RiskMap Models}
\usage{
\method{summary}{RiskMap.spatial.cv}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A `RiskMap.spatial.cv` object containing cross-validation scores for each
model. This obtained as an output from \code{\link{assess_pp}}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to or from other methods.}
}
\value{
A matrix of summary scores with models as rows and metrics as columns,
        with class `"summary.RiskMap.spatial.cv"`.
}
\description{
This function provides a summary of cross-validation scores for different spatial models
obtained as an output from \code{\link{assess_pp}}.
}
\details{
The function computes a matrix where rows correspond to models and columns correspond
to performance metrics (e.g., CRPS, SCRPS). The scores are weighted by subset sizes
to provide an average score across subsets for each model and metric.
