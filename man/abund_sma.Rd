\title{Female Culex pipiens abundance (collections) in the Sacramento Metropolitan Area}
\format{
A data frame with one row per collection event (for a total of 1552 collection events) and 6 variables:
\describe{
  \item{lon}{Numeric. Longitude in decimal degrees (WGS84).}
  \item{lat}{Numeric. Latitude in decimal degrees (WGS84).}
  \item{total_females}{Integer. Total number of female Cx. pipiens captured in the event.}
  \item{date}{Date. Exact collection date (local).}
  \item{trap_nights}{Integer. Number of trap-nights for the event.}
  \item{trap_type}{Character. Acronym for trap type used to collect mosquitoes. These include: \code{"NJLT"} (New Jersey Light Trap), \code{"GRVD"} (Gravid Trap), and \code{"MMT"} (Mosquito Magnet Trap).}
}
}
\source{
Constructed from \code{sample_collections} in the \code{vectorsurvR} R package.

\description{
A dataset of mosquito collection events used to quantify abundance of female
Culex pipiens in the Sacramento Metropolitan Area (Sacramento, Placer, El Dorado
counties, California, USA). Each row represents a single collection event at a
specific location and date.
}
\details{
Derived from the \pkg{vectorsurvR} sample datasets by:
\enumerate{
\item Filtering to female \emph{Culex pipiens} collection records within the Sacramento
Metropolitan Area (SMA) using point-in-polygon against the union of Sacramento, Placer,
and El Dorado county boundaries.
\item Summing counts and trap-nights per unique \emph{location}–\emph{date}–\emph{trap type}.
\item Coordinates are kept as WGS84 (EPSG:4326).
}

This sample dataset is intended for examples, mapping, and vector-index workflows. It is
not official surveillance output. Dates span the same period as the \pkg{vectorsurvR}
sample (e.g., 2015–2021).
